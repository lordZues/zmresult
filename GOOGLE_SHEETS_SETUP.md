# Google Sheets Integration Setup - COMPLETED

## ✅ Integration Status: READY TO USE

Your Google Sheets integration is now fully configured and ready to use! Here's what has been set up:

### What's Configured:
- **Google Sheet ID**: `135Ob4gCnXiNk0dL0V7nyk3ZMwR5HxOLK3aTOrYZLcUo`
- **Target Sheet**: "prospecting leads" (with fallback to "Sheet1")
- **Service Account**: Configured with your provided credentials
- **Authentication**: JWT-based service account authentication

### Data Structure:
Each lead submission will create a new row with:
1. **Timestamp** (South African time)
2. **Name**
3. **Email**
4. **Phone**
5. **Business Type**
6. **Challenges**

### Next Steps:

1. **Prepare Your Google Sheet**:
   - Open your sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/135Ob4gCnXiNk0dL0V7nyk3ZMwR5HxOLK3aTOrYZLcUo/edit
   - Create a sheet tab named "prospecting leads" (or keep "Sheet1")
   - Add these headers in row 1:
     - A1: Timestamp
     - B1: Name
     - C1: Email
     - D1: Phone
     - E1: Business Type
     - F1: Challenges

2. **Share Sheet with Service Account**:
   - Click "Share" in your Google Sheet
   - Add this email as an Editor: `google@gold-subset-456420-a6.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - This allows the service account to write data to your sheet

3. **Test the Integration**:
   - Fill out the form on your website
   - Check your Google Sheet for the new lead entry
   - Each submission will appear with a South African timestamp

### Security Features:
- ✅ Service account authentication (more secure than API keys)
- ✅ JWT token-based access
- ✅ Automatic token refresh
- ✅ Fallback sheet handling
- ✅ Input validation and error handling

### Troubleshooting:
If leads don't appear:
1. Ensure the service account email has Editor access to your sheet
2. Check that the sheet name is "prospecting leads" or "Sheet1"
3. Verify the sheet headers match the expected format
4. Check Supabase edge function logs for any errors

The integration is now live and will automatically save all form submissions to your Google Sheet!
