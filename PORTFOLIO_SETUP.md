## Mock Data

The system includes 8 pre-configured mock portfolio entries showcasing different industries and services:

3. Run the following code in the console:

```javascript
import { seedPortfolios } from './src/utils/seedPortfolios';
seedPortfolios().then(result => console.log('Seeded:', result));
```

Alternatively, you can add portfolios manually through the admin interface.

## Page Routes

## Database Tables

The system uses three related tables:

1. **portfolios** - Main project information
2. **portfolio_images** - Multiple images per portfolio
3. **portfolio_metrics** - Performance metrics (leads, revenue, etc.)

All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled:
- Public can view published portfolios
- Only authenticated admin users can create/edit/delete

## Adding a New Portfolio Entry

1. Log into admin portal at `/admin/login`
2. Click "Add New Project" button
3. Fill in all required fields marked with *
4. Add services by selecting from dropdown and clicking + button

7. Write the challenge, solution, and full story
8. Optionally add client testimonial
9. Toggle "Featured" to show on homepage
10. Toggle "Published" to make visible to public
11. Click "Save Project"

## Image URLs

For portfolio thumbnails and images, you can use:
- **Pexels** - Free stock photos: https://www.pexels.com
- **Unsplash** - Free high-quality images: https://unsplash.com
- **Your own images** - Upload to Supabase Storage and use the URL

**Note:** The current implementation uses direct URLs. For production use, consider implementing Supabase Storage integration for image uploads.

## Best Practices

### For Case Studies
- Use clear, compelling project titles
- Write short descriptions under 200 characters for gallery cards
- Include 2-4 key metrics that demonstrate impact
- Tell a story: Challenge → Solution → Results
- Include client testimonials when possible
- Use high-quality, relevant images
- Mark your 3 best projects as "Featured"

### For Metrics
- Use specific numbers (e.g., "127+ Leads" not "Many Leads")
- Include percentage increases where applicable
- Mix different metric types (leads, revenue, conversion, engagement)
- Order metrics by importance

### URL Slugs
- Auto-generated from project title
- Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., "tech-startup-lead-generation")
- Must be unique across all portfolio items
- Used in case study URLs

## Troubleshooting

### Can't log in to admin portal
- Verify user exists in Supabase Authentication
- Check that email/password are correct
- Ensure Supabase environment variables are set in `.env`

### Portfolio items not showing
- Check that `is_published` is set to `true`
- Verify the portfolio was saved successfully
- Check browser console for errors

### Images not loading
- Verify image URLs are valid and accessible
- Check for CORS issues if hosting images elsewhere
- Ensure URLs use HTTPS, not HTTP

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding these features as your portfolio grows:

- Direct image upload to Supabase Storage
- Bulk import/export of portfolio data
- Portfolio categories/tags
- Client logo upload and management
- Before/after image comparisons
